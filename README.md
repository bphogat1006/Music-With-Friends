# Music With Friends

This website allows you and your friends to see what music you have in common with each other. This was created using the Spotify API, so you must have a Spotify account in order to use it (Premium is not required).

## How it works

### Sign in

Upon navigating to the site, you will be asked to sign in with your Spotify account before proceeding. After authorization is granted, you will be directed to the main page.

Music With Friends will immediately start scanning your library (liked tracks, public playlists, private playlists). This may take a while depending on the size of your library.

### View listening statistics

In the meantime, you may scroll down to view your top favorite artists and tracks for the "short-term," "medium-term," and "long-term" time ranges. Each list will contain up to 50 artists/tracks, depending on your listening.

### Compare with friends

Upon completion of the library scan, an algorithm determines which artists are your favorite. It ranks each artist you listen to and compiles the list which is stored for later use.

Then a list other Spotify users who have been on the website will appear. You may either pick from the dropdown or search for a specific user by their Spotify display name.

When you click on a friend's name, Music With Friends will compare both of your data and start creating a playlist of all* the artists and songs you both have in common. A link to the completed playlist will appear, and it will also be saved into your library automatically for easy access.

_*Limited to 5 tracks per artists, and 1000 tracks total._

## Usage & Demo

Spotify refuses to grant Music With Friends a quota extension because it analyzes each user's library to determine their favorite artists, which violates the TOS. Unfortunately, this is not something I can fix because that is the entire purpose of the site. A quota extension would allow anyone on the web with a Spotify account to use the website freely - but until I can get it approved, I must manually add your Spotify email address if you wish to use the website.
